# Genetically informed brain atlas (GIANT) for enhancing neuroimaging genetics studies

This repository includes the **Genetically Informed brAiN Ttlas (GIANT)** with its implementation, and all imaging-genetics subsequent analysis summary statistics for the GIANT. 

## GIANT - A genetically informed brain atlas

We introduce GIANT, a genetically informed brain atlas. Our 3D clustering algorithm was applied separately to gray matter and white matter, and the best-tuned brain parcellations were integrated to define GIANT.  Our annotation results divided GIANT into 7 anatomical sub-structures: cerebellum (**A**), deep gray matter and white matter structure (**B**), frontal structure (**C** and **D**), occipital structure (**F**), parietal structure (**G**), temporal structure (**H**), and others (**E**).
